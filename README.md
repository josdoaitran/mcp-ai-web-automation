# mcp-web-automation-playwright-cursor
- Let start with a mcp for covering web-automation with playwright in cursor.
- It is based on:
## MCP - ExecuteAutomation: https://github.com/executeautomation/mcp-playwright
## Cursor AI Editor: https://www.cursor.com/
## MCP feature in Cursor: https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context and tools to LLMs. Think of MCP as a plugin system for Cursor - it allows you to extend the Agentâ€™s capabilities by connecting it to various data sources and tools through standardized interfaces.
