# Ideas
Build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with Selenium for web automation testing.

- Context Management: Maintains test context between requests
- Intelligent Element Selection: Uses Claude to find the most reliable selectors for elements
- Dynamic Analysis: Analyzes pages and suggests test actions
- Self-Healing Tests: Can adapt to UI changes by focusing on element descriptions rather than static selectors
- Verification Logic: Uses AI to verify page content matches expectations
