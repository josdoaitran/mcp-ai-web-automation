# Ideas
Build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with Selenium for web automation testing.

- Context Management: Maintains test context between requests
- Intelligent Element Selection: Uses Claude to find the most reliable selectors for elements
- Dynamic Analysis: Analyzes pages and suggests test actions
- Self-Healing Tests: Can adapt to UI changes by focusing on element descriptions rather than static selectors
- Verification Logic: Uses AI to verify page content matches expectations

# Setup the local environment
- Install Python 3
- Python virtual environment in your local
```
# Set up virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
# On MacOSX / Linux
source venv/bin/activate  
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
- Install the dependencies
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
